## Description
This project uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM to create an API for a social network application. I was motivated to build this project because I, like many others, use social media in my everyday life and in creating this project I thought it was cool understanding how many different media platforms organize there data. This project stands out because I used a unique method to create a time stamp, I actually did a lot of work with a tutor to come up with this timestamp function instead of using the generic javascript date method.

## Installation
Using the terminal, after navigating to the directory install all necessary packages by typing 'npm install', then to start the application's server by typing 'npm start'. The server is then running and can be viewed on insomnia at 'http://localhost:3001'. From there please reference the walkthrough video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqvWiee7NyJVuSV1DQXgkGAsGCEqsJlC/view). And if you are having trouble starting the server please watch [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKLq5hGZqQginLzrTFk42naRPO_S3Le3/view).

## Usage
To use this application please follow the installation instructions then using insomnia you can see the server in use, remember to use insomnia because this is a back end application. For guidance please watch my walk through video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqvWiee7NyJVuSV1DQXgkGAsGCEqsJlC/view).
